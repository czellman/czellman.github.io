I am a member of the Williams group - we are located in 4D LABS at Simon Fraser University (SFU), Burnaby, British Columbia Canada. In our group, we study organic materials, with a focus on liquid crystalline materials. 

In my research, I investigate discotic (disc-shaped) liquid crystals (DLCs). I am in the 3rd year of my PhD studies.
